## Show Code #3 (4 of 4 points)

Code compiles as desired. There is a Map. I didn't see a Buffer. It could be in the graphic game, but you want to
make sure that you have one somewhere. As a user experience item, I think it would help if entering a room printed
the full room description, not just the name.

## Show Code #6 (4 of 4 points)

The actor-based MUD compiles and runs the way it should.

## Show Code #7 (4 of 4 points)

I can log in multiple players and have them communicate.

## Show Code #12 (4 of 4 points)

There is a binary heap being used by the activity manager and the NPCs still move around.
