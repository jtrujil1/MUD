## Show Code #3 (4 of 4 points)

Code compiles as desired. There is a Map. I didn't see a Buffer. It could be in the graphic game, but you want to
make sure that you have one somewhere. As a user experience item, I think it would help if entering a room printed
the full room description, not just the name.
